							<p> You’re going to hate how much you love the extra soft yet snappy personality of this park destroyer.It ’s all thanks to NEW Filet-O-Flex which improves the entire ride with a skate-like feel that still rips when you need it with ramped up edge-hold and durability. Flat Top combines steady stability with a catch-free feel while extra pop and snap is retained with Jumper Cables.</p>
