         	<h2 class="title">Ambush Boots</h2>
							<p> The Ambush defies convention by combining versatile mid-range response and full-featured tech in a boot that's lighter and lasts longer than the competition's equivalent. Slightly softer, it offers a high-performance ride for those who prefer the stealth support and powerful lacing control of Speed Zone. Lightweight tech includes the Wishbone upper cuff with Jumper Cables on both sides for twice the snap, rebound, and life without sacrificing the high tweak-ability of a softer boot.</p>
